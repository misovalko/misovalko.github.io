  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide a univariate and multivariate
	analysis of genomic microbial data and salivary mass-spectrometry
	proteomic profiles for dental caries outcomes. In order to determine
	potential useful biomarkers for dental caries, a multivariate classification
	analysis was employed to build predictive models capable of classifying
	microbial and salivary sample profiles with generalization performance.
	We used high-throughput methodologies including multiplexed microbial
	arrays and SELDI-TOF-MS profiling to characterize the oral flora
	and salivary proteome in 204 children aged 1-8 years (n = 118 caries-free,
	n = 86 caries-active). The population received little dental care
	and was deemed at high risk for childhood caries. Findings of the
	study indicate that models incorporating both microbial and proteomic
	data are superior to models of only microbial or salivary data alone.
	Comparison of results for the combined and independent data suggests
	that the combination of proteomic and microbial sources is beneficial
	for the classification accuracy and that combined data lead to improved
	predictive models for caries-active and caries-free patients. The
	best predictive model had a 6\% test error, >92\% sensitivity, and
	>95\% specificity. These findings suggest that further characterization
	of the oral microflora and the salivary proteome associated with
	health and caries may provide clinically useful biomarkers to better
	predict future caries experience.},
