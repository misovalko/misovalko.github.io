  title = {Evolving Neural Networks for Statistical Decision Theory},
  school = {Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia},
  year = {2005},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {Real biological networks are able to make decisions. We will show
	that this behavior can be observed even in some simple architectures
	of biologically plausible neural models. The great interest of this
	thesis is also to contribute to methods of statistical decision theory
	by giving a lead how to evolve the neural networks to solve miscellaneous
	decision tasks.}
