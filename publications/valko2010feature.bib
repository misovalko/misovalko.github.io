  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to understand what characteris-tics
	and features of clinical data influence physician.s deci-sion about
	ordering laboratory tests or prescribing medica-tions the most. We
	conduct our analysis on data and decisions extracted from electronic
	health records of 4486 post-surgical cardiac patients. The summary
	statistics for 335 different lab order decisions and 407 medication
	decisions are reported. We show that in many cases, physician.s lab-order
	and medication decisions are predicted well by simple patterns such
	as last value of a single test result, time since a certain lab test
	was ordered or time since certain procedure was executed.},
