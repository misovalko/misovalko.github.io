  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel algorithm for semisupervised learning.
	This algorithm learns graph cuts that maximize the margin with respect
	to the labels induced by the harmonic function solution. We motivate
	the approach, compare it to existing work, and prove a bound on its
	generalization error. The quality of our solutions is evaluated on
	a synthetic problem and three UCI ML repository datasets. In most
	cases, we outperform manifold regularization of support vector machines,
	which is a state-of-the-art approach to semi-supervised max-margin
	learning.},
