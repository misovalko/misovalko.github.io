  abstract = {Automated syndromic surveillance systems often classify patients into
	syndromic categories based on free-text chief complaints. Chief complaints
	(CC) demonstrate low to moderate sensitivity in identify-ing syndromic
	cases. Emergency Department (ED) reports promise more detailed clinical
	information that may increase sensitivity of detection.}
