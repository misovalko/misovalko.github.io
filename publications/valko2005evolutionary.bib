  abstract = {This paper presents an application of the biologically realistic JASTAP
	neural network model to classification tasks. The JASTAP neural network
	model is presented as an alternative to the basic multi-layer perceptron
	model. An evolutionary procedure previously applied to the simultaneous
	solution of feature selection and neural network training on standard
	multi-layer perceptrons is extended with JASTAP model. Preliminary
	results on IRIS standard data set give evidence that this extension
	allows the use of smaller neural networks that can handle noisier
	data without any degradation in classification accuracy.}
